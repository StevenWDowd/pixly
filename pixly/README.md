 It includes a React frontend, Python/Flask backend, and PostgreSQL database with photos being stored on S3.

## Features:
- Features include uploading a .jpeg file, searching for images based on their extracted EXIF data, and making simple photo edits such as changing a photo from black to white.
- Future features include rotating photos, changing photos to and from coloring changes, image resizing, etc. Testing is another additional feature we hope to implement.
